# ilp-finance-calculator
offered an ilp? oh my god! axa wealth harvest? who is being harvested, let's see.
i wondered if i could create a simulation and i found out how much was actually charged.
i just did this because i was frustrated about how the plan is presented and needed to figure things out.

_this is by no means an accurate simulation of the plan, it is just a rough (very jaded calculation) of the costs that you are actually paying the insurance companies._

**assumptions for the code**
- monthly premiumns paid $300
- for a locked in duration of 11 years
- no bonuses given to offset high costs
- annual total fee of 3.5% paid, charged monthly thus 3.5/100/12
- faked return on investment 15%, computated monthly thus 15/100/12 (totally unrealistic as the market is never stagnant lol)
- calculated only for the 11 year period

if you found any errors, or have a better way to do this, or even, find it wrong, do let me know, hit me up at jeslynlxy@hotmail.com
